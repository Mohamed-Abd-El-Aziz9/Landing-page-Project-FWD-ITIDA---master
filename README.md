# Landing Page Project

### so let's jump to the methodology that is followed in this project

### I start with the navigation bar, and after search and search and search I make my own idea for how can I build this navigation bar 

### I decided to build it by building every aspect of li in individual lines of code to practice all functions that I learned in the class 


### and in this case meany errors in my code the first time but actually, I learned a lot of it!


### But Finally i did it! , and acutally very proud of it :)



#### Element.getBoundingClientRect();

## with this amazing function i could really detemined where the user is now!

## check the photo that i graped from MDN , after analyising it carfully i could be able to determine the dimention very will due to the section height!



## finially i want to thank all of you , teacher, tutors , reviwers and webinars holder for all the effort you put to teach us this amazing content , can't wait to see you in the weather journal app project! see you soon
